There's no real end goal behind it, just me implementing neat ideas that come my way via reddit, Discord, other games or even my imagination.\n\n For a full list of everything added and an up to date look at what I'm working on, you can take a look at my Github Repository here: https://github.com/erasels/Aspiration-StS/ \n\nLet me know if you have questions, suggestions or found an error.",
